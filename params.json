{"name":"Sculpture Learning ","tagline":"Automatic behaviours generation software for interactive art sculptures","body":"### CBLA Test Bed Project\r\n\r\n## Overview\r\n\r\nThe software for the CBLA Test Bed was written to enable both reliable local functions and complex inter-node functions.\r\nThe main microcontroller used in the current version of the CBLA Test Bed is Teensy. Its code is written in Arduino and compiled using Teensyduino. Each Teensy is connected to computer through USB connection. \r\n\r\n## System Requirements\r\n\r\n* Windows OS (tested on Windows 8, but should work on XP, Vista and & too)\r\n* [Python 3.3+](https://www.python.org/downloads/)\r\n* [pyUSB](https://github.com/walac/pyusb)\r\n* [libusb-win32](http://sourceforge.net/p/libusb-win32/wiki/Home/)\r\n* [Arduino IDE](http://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software)\r\n* [Teensyduino Add-on](https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/td_download.html)\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
